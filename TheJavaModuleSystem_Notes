3.2.2	EXPERIMENTING WITH UNRELIABLE CONFIGURATIONS
Pag 170

----------------------------------
- The best name for a module is the reverse-domain naming scheme that is already commonly used for packages.
- The module name must be globally unique and stable.
- A requires directive contains a module name.
- An exports directive contains a package name.
- Module descriptor: a module-info.class file in the root directory.
- Module declaration: is a module-info.java file in the projectâ€™s root source folder.
	 -> declaration/source, then descriptor/bytes
- Goals of the module system:reliable configuration and strong encapsulation
